### thal/cc file
- This corresponds the the number of the thalamus/cc file in the database 

### mrsthal/cc exclude
- Binary exclusion for unrecoverable scans
- Y = yes
- N = no

### Exclusion reason 
- Explains the reason why the scan was excluded from the study
- dead = died during scan preparation or during data acquisition
- inc = animal was included
- ppr = poor peak resolution
- lac = abnormally high lactate (Lac) peaks
- naa = abnormally low NAA peaks

> [!Note]\
> "E" written in the name column indicates exclusion, exclusion reason column specifies the exact reason for exclusion

### Metabolite information 
- CrCH2 (Creatine methylene)= Involved in energy metabolism and buffering cellular energy levels.
- Ala (Alanine)=  An amino acid that plays a role in glucose metabolism and energy production.
- Asp (Aspartate)= Functions as a neurotransmitter and participates in the urea cycle and energy metabolism.
- Cr (Creatine)= Essential for energy storage and transfer in muscle and brain tissues.
- GABA (Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid)= Acts as the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system, modulating neuronal excitability.
- Glc (Glucose)= The primary energy source for the brain and many other tissues.
- Gln (Glutamine)= An amino acid important for nitrogen metabolism and neurotransmitter synthesis.
- GSH (Glutathione)= A critical antioxidant that protects cells from oxidative stress and maintains redox balance.
- Glu (Glutamate)= The main excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain, involved in synaptic plasticity and cognitive functions.
- GPC (Glycerophosphocholine)= A metabolite involved in membrane phospholipid metabolism and choline production.
- Ins (Inositol)= A component of cell membranes and a precursor for signaling molecules that regulate various cellular processes.
- Lac (Lactate)= A byproduct of anaerobic metabolism, indicating metabolic stress or increased energy demand.
- Lip09 (Lipid 09)= Represents a class of lipids, which are involved in cellular membrane structure and signaling.
- Lip13a (Lipid 13a)= Another lipid variant, contributing to membrane integrity and signaling pathways.
- Lip13b (Lipid 13b)= Similar to Lip13a, involved in membrane function and cellular processes.
- Lip20 (Lipid 20)= A lipid associated with cellular membranes and signaling mechanisms.
- MM09 (Metabolite Marker 09)= Refers to a specific metabolite or lipid with functions in membrane composition or signaling.
- MM12 (Metabolite Marker 12)= Another metabolite marker, potentially involved in cellular energy or membrane processes.
- MM14 (Metabolite Marker 14)= Indicates a metabolite relevant to metabolism or membrane function.
- MM17 (Metabolite Marker 17)= Represents a metabolite with potential roles in cellular function or energy metabolism.
- MM20 (Metabolite Marker 20)= A specific metabolite or lipid marker with roles in cellular processes or energy.
- tLM20 (Total Lipid Marker 20)= Represents a broad category of lipids involved in various biological functions.
