## Abstract
Research on human phenotyping has broadened our knowledge of the genetic foundations of neurodevelopmental disorders, notably autism spectrum disorder. However, moving beyond correlations in human cohorts presents difficulties. In this study, we examine neurometabolic differences linked to autism using the SHANK3 mouse model. We use proton (1H) magnetic resonance spectroscopy to track neurochemical alterations in the transgenic mouse models. This non-invasive method measures the concentrations of in vivo neurometabolites.

We acquired single voxel PRESS scans in homologous brain areas—the cingulate cortex and thalamus—across three genotypes: SHANK3+/+ (wildtype), SHANK3-/+ (heterozygous), and SHANK3-/- (knockout homozygous). We imaged mixed-sex mice during adolescence (30 days post-natal) or early adulthood (70 days post-natal) using a Bruker BioSpec 11.7T scanner. We processed all spectral data using Spectroscopy Analysis Tools (SPANT), with rigorous quality control measures and visual inspection by two analysts. We compared metabolite concentrations using effect size analysis with unpaired Hedge’s g, examining how genotype affects metabolite levels in wild-type, heterozygous, and homozygous mice.

## Goals
1. To document region-specific neurometabolic differences associated with the SHANK3 mouse model
2. To examine the downstream metabolic consequences caused by Shank3 disruptions
3. To bridge the gap between preclinical findings and human phenotyping
